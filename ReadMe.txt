The models and controllers are text files for your reference. The views were not included as they are numerous and Microsoft Visual Studio and MVC 5 will auto generate what’s needed. This in fact is the reason for moving to MVC 5, because much of the code, as long as convention is followed is generated by Visual Studio, drastically shortening the time from concept to functional site.

The web.config is included but is also self-generating from Visual Studio, just remember to ensure the database pointers are pointing to the correct location on your local hard drive. See the comment in the web.config file for more information.
